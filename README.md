If you can't get your code to push to GitHub, contact the TAs or Professor ASAP when you're done with your exam.

### 2. When you're done: Copy and paste your code to Learning Suite
Click somewhere in your python code, then press cmd + a to select everything, then cmd + c to copy it, then go to Learning Suite and press cmd + v to paste it.
